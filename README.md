# Ad Performance Predictor

In this project we will be working with a training advertising data set, indicating whether or not a particular internet user clicked on an Advertisement. This dataset is freely available on Kaggle. We will use logistic regression to create a model that predicts whether or not an internet user will click on an ad based on the features of that user.

This data set contains the following features:
- 'Daily Time Spent on Site': consumer time on site in minutes
- 'Age': cutomer age in years
- 'Area Income': Avg. Income of geographical area of consumer
- 'Daily Internet Usage': Avg. minutes a day consumer is on the internet
- 'Ad Topic Line': Headline of the advertisement
- 'City': City of consumer
- 'Male': Whether or not consumer was male
- 'Country': Country of consumer
- 'Timestamp': Time at which consumer clicked on Ad or closed window
- 'Clicked on Ad': 0 or 1 indicated clicking on Ad
